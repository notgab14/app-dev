# John Wick

## John Wick is a 2014 American action thriller film directed by Chad Stahelski and written by Derek Kolstad. Keanu Reeves stars as John Wick, a legendary hitman who comes out of retirement to seek revenge against the men who killed his dog, a final gift from his recently deceased wife. The film also stars Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki, Bridget Moynahan, Dean Winters, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, and Willem Dafoe.

Over the course of his violent career as a killer-for-hire, John Wick has earned a widespread reputation as one of the world's deadliest and most skilled professional assassins. His extraordinary exploits, formidable skill set, lethal precision, and unwavering focus and determination to complete his tasks have solidified his status as both a legendary and infamous figure within the international criminal underworld: known and feared by many as the Baba Yaga (Баба-Яга) or The Boogeyman. He previously worked for the Tarasov Mob until his retirement. He retired in order to spend time with his wife, Helen Wick, who later passed away from an unidentified illness. His superior, Viggo Tarasov, promised to allow John to quit if he first completed an "impossible task": killing all of Tarasov's enemies in a single night. Having succeeded, John retired and lived peacefully for just over five years. Following his wife's death, John came out of retirement after Viggo's son, Iosef Tarasov, murdered his dog, Daisy (who was gifted to John posthumously by Helen to help him grieve), and stole his car during a home invasion. He succeeds in his quest by killing Iosef and eventually Viggo, before reacquiring his car from Viggo's brother Abram Tarasov._
